github-todotxt
==============

A utility to sync [Github](https://github.com/) issues that have been assigned
to you with your [todotxt](http://todotxt.com/) so you have one place to keep
all the things you have to do.

Install
-------

The easiest way to install is to use [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```shell
npm install -g github-todotxt
```

You can also fork the repository, or really just download the .coffee file
and run it directly with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

Usage
-----

The script takes the following arguments:

* ***-t*** (***--token***): You need an
  [OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) token from Github (with repo scope) to
  run github-todotxt. You can get one at https://github.com/settings/tokens .
  Note that Github only shows the token once, so copy-and-paste it!
* ***-f*** (***--file***): Path to your todo.txt file. The default is
  `$HOME/Dropbox/todo/todo.txt`, where `$HOME` is your home directory. Note that
  this file will be written to! We'll make a backup, though.
* ***-q*** (***--quiet***): Make the output less noisy. It's not that loud, but
  maybe you want it really, really quiet.
* ***-c*** (***--config***): Path to the config file (see config file section
  below). If you don't provide this argument, the default is
  `$HOME/.github-todotxt.json`.
* ***-h*** (***--help***): Show pretty much this help output.

Config file
-----------

You can put options into the config file (`$HOME/github-todotxt.json` by
default). It's just a [JSON](http://json.org/) file, with a single object in it,
with one property for each command-line option, like `token` or `file`.

For example:

```json
{
  "token": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890",
  "file": "/home/evan/testing/todo.txt"
}
```

Environment variables
---------------------

You can also set environment variables (like in your `.bashrc`) for each of the
configuration options. Just all-caps the option long name and prepend
`GITHUB_TODOTXT_`, like `GITHUB_TODOTXT_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TODOTXT_FILE`.

todo.txt lines
--------------

`github-todotxt` looks for lines with the `issue:` metadata prefix in them, kind
of like this:

```
(B) 2016-06-27 Use a configuration file issue:evanp/github-todotxt#5 +GithubTodotxt
```

It uses the same format as when referring to remote issues in Github comments:
`username/repository#number`. You can't abbreviate that in any way.

It will automatically close todo.txt items (prepend an `x`) for issues that have
been closed on Github.

It will automatically add todo.txt items for issues that exist on Github that
don't exist in todo.txt.

It will automatically close todo.txt items (prepend an `x`) for issues that are
not assigned to you on Github (probably because you re-assigned them).

It looks at all Github issues in all repositories you have access to. It only
syncs with issues that are assigned to you.

It creates automatic project markers, based on the repository name.

Backup
------

`github-todotxt` does a single backup file, right next to the main file, with a
`.bak` appended to the name. Hopefully that doesn't clobber your existing .bak
file. If you see a problem in how github-todotxt works, check for the .bak file.
